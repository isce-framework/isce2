###ionospheric correction module parameters
###the values below are the default values used by the module
###remove # to set the parameters

#consider burst properties in ionosphere computation: False
#height of ionosphere layer in km: 200.0

#maximum window size for filtering ionosphere phase:         200
#minimum window size for filtering ionosphere phase:         100
#maximum window size for filtering ionosphere azimuth shift: 150
#minimum window size for filtering ionosphere azimuth shift: 75

###seperated islands or areas usually affect ionosphere estimation and it's better to mask them
###out. check ion/date1_date2/ion_cal/raw_no_projection.ion for areas to be masked out.
###The parameter is a 2-D list. Each element in the 2-D list is a four-element list: [firstLine,
###lastLine, firstColumn, lastColumn], with line/column numbers starting with 1. If one of the
###four elements is specified as -1, the program will use firstLine/lastLine/firstColumn/
###lastColumn instead. For exmple, if you want to mask the following two areas out, you can
###specify a 2-D list like:
###[[100, 200, 100, 200],[1000, 1200, 500, 600]]
#areas masked out in ionospheric phase estimation: None

###better NOT try changing the following two parameters, since they are related
###to the filtering parameters above
#total number of azimuth looks in the ionosphere processing:             50
#total number of range looks in the ionosphere processing:               200
###the above numbers should be integer multiples of the below numbers
#number of azimuth looks at first stage for ionosphere phase unwrapping: 10
#number of range looks at first stage for ionosphere phase unwrapping:   40
