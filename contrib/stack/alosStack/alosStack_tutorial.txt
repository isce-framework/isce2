This is the tutorial of alosStack processor.


###########################################
#        0. SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
###########################################

Set environment variable 'ISCE_STACK'
export ISCE_STACK=CODE_DIR/isce2/contrib/stack/

where CODE_DIR is the directory of your isce code. The alosStack is not installed in your ISCE_HOME directory when you install
the software, so CODE_DIR is your ISCE2 source code directory rather than installation directory.

#            1. PREPARE DATA
###########################################

1. ALOS-2 data
Currently the processor only supports the processing of a stack of data acquired in the same mode.

To find the acquisition mode code, check the unpacked ALOS-2 product. For example, in the following
file name

IMG-HH-ALOS2183010685-171012-FBDR1.1__A
                             ^^^
FBD (indicated by ^) is the acquisition mode code. Here is the list of acquistion modes:

 Operation Mode   |   Mode (AUIG2)  |    Mode (in file name)
--------------------------------------------------------------
   spotlight      |       SPT       |    SBS
--------------------------------------------------------------
   stripmap       |       SM1       |    UBS, UBD
                  |       SM2       |    HBS, HBD, HBQ
                  |       SM3       |    FBS, FBD, FBQ
--------------------------------------------------------------
   ScanSAR        |       WD1       |    WBS, WBD, WWS, WWD
                  |       WD2       |    VBS, VBD


Create a folder such as 'saf_d169', and in this folder, unpack all frames of each date in an individual folder
named YYMMDD. YYMMDD is the acquistion date, and it must be in this format. Now the data directory should look
like

saf_d169_data-------150225-------IMG-HH-ALOS2041062800-150225-WBDR1.1__D-F1
                 |__150408    |__IMG-HH-ALOS2041062800-150225-WBDR1.1__D-F2

2. DEM and water body

You MUST FIRST have an account to download DEM and water body. See
https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2#notes-on-digital-elevation-models
or
https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2
for more details.

See input xml file alosStack.xml in this folder on how to download DEM and water body.


###########################################
#            2. PROCESS DATA
###########################################

1. Create and enter a folder for processing data, e.g.
mkdir saf_d169_proc
cd saf_d169_proc

2. Input xml file alosStack.xml can be found in code directory. Copy it to current folder and simply set 
the parameters.
cp ${ISCE_STACK}/alosStack/alosStack.xml ./

3. Create command files for processing data. Run
${ISCE_STACK}/alosStack/create_cmds.py -stack_par alosStack.xml

4. Do most of the single date processing. Run
./cmd_1.sh

In cmd_1.sh and other command files, note that you can split the 'for loop' in each step into a number
of parallel runs. See command file for details.

Higly recommended parallel processing steps in each command file.

cmd_1.sh:
estimate SLC offsets
resample to a common grid (WD1 SLC size may be up to 7.2 G, so each run requires this much memory!)

cmd_2.sh
form interferograms (does not requires a lot of computation, more parallel runs recommended)
mosaic interferograms (does not requires a lot of computation, more parallel runs recommended)

cmd_3.sh
subband interferograms (does not requires a lot of computation, more parallel runs recommended)

cmd_4.sh
all steps


5. InSAR processing before ionosphere correction. Run
./cmd_2.sh

6. Ionosphere correction (if do ionospheric phase estimation, by default True). If the following parameter of 
the input xml file is True (default)

    <!--<property name="do ionospheric phase estimation">True</property>-->

Run
./cmd_3.sh

After it finishes, check the images in folder 'fig_ion' to see if ionosphere estimation is OK for each
pair. The anomalies include dense fringes or slight phase difference between adjacent swaths in ScanSAR
interferograms after removing ionosphere. There might also be dense fringes elsewhere. These are all anomalies
and the associated ionosphere estimation results should not be used in the next steps.

At the end of this command file, there is a step called 'estimate ionospheric phase for each date'. If you found 
some pairs with ionosphere estimation anomalies, specify them by adding argument '-exc_pair' to the command ion_ls.py. 
Make sure all dates are still connected after excluding these pairs, and then run ion_ls.py.

You can plot baselines to see if the pairs are fully connected, e.g.
${ISCE_STACK}/alosStack/plot_baseline.py -baseline baseline/baseline_center.txt -pairs_dir pairs_ion -pairs_exc 150520-150701 -output baselines.pdf

If the following parameters of the input xml file are True (default)

    <!--<property name="do ionospheric phase estimation">True</property>-->
    <!--<property name="apply ionospheric phase correction">True</property>-->

there is a final step called 'correct ionosphere' in cmd_3.sh, uncomment the code marked by '#uncomment to run this command'
and then run the entire step.

7. InSAR processing after ionosphere correction. Run
./cmd_4.sh

If everything is OK, you may consider removing the huge slc files in folder dates_resampled. When you need them in
the future, you can re-run the commands in the '#resample to a common grid' step in cmd_1.sh.

Furthermore, you may consider removing the huge original data files you unpacked previously.


###########################################
#          3. ADDING MORE DATES
###########################################

Sometimes we want to add new acquistions to the already processed stack. To do this, 

1. Upack the new acquistions in data directory following #1. PREPARE DATA.

2. Repeat the processing in #2. PROCESS DATA.

We recommend saving previous command files in a folder before new processing. Note that even the previously processed
pairs will be reprocessed again by cmd_4.sh if the following parameters of the input xml file are True (default)

    <!--<property name="do ionospheric phase estimation">True</property>-->
    <!--<property name="apply ionospheric phase correction">True</property>-->

because ionospheric phase will be estimated by ion_ls.py at the end of cmd_3.sh for each date with new pairs included,
and therefore all steps after ion_ls.py should be reprocessed.

###########################################
#            5. KNOWN ISSUES
###########################################

1. Issues with Ionospheric Correction
According to our experience, ionospheric correction works for most of the interferograms. Because it 
relies on coherence and phase unwrapping, it does not work in some cases. These include:

(1) data have low coherence
(2) the majority of the imaged area is low coherence area like lake, ocean...
(3) the imaged area is completely divided into several isolated areas by low coherence areas, such as
    islands.

In addition to the above issues, there are also data-mode-related issues.
(1) ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry. While you can process one single subswath, it's better to process 
more than one subswath if the addistional subswath has good coherence. This is good for ionospheric 
correction.

(2) Range distortions in JAXA product. This mostly happens in stripmap-stripmap interferometry using 
data not covering Japan. If you see very dense fringes in the corrected inteferogram, probably it is 
caused by this problem. This has been reported to JAXA and JAXA is working on debugging the focusing 
program.

UPDATE: On November 20, 2018 (JST), JAXA updated the software for PALSAR-2 standard products. Therefore, 
if your product is ordered after this time, you don't have this problem.


2. How do I improve ionospheric correction?

First of all, we recommend reading through cmd_3.sh before manually improving ionosphere estimation results.

Isolated areas lead to relative phase unwrapping errors, and therefore leads to significant errors in ionosphere
estimation result, usually shown as dense fringes in the corrected interferograms. If your scene covers an area 
with two or more isolated areas and you are interested in one of the areas, you can mask out the other areas by 
setting "areas masked out in ionospheric phase estimation".

Or if you have processed the data, you can also specify the argument -masked_areas in ion_filt.py in cmd_3.sh.
Then check the updated results following step '#check ionosphere estimation results' in cmd_3.sh

For ScanSAR, the software uses some accurate values for removing phase difference between adjacent swaths.
This, however, does not work well sometimes as a result of the inconistencies between different JAXA products,
especially products processed by different versions of JAXA software. As a result of this, you may see dense
fringes in the ionospheric correction result. In this case, you can try not to use aforementioned accurate
values by setting -snap in ion_subband.py in cmd_3.sh, and run this command and the remaining commands to see
if ionosphere estimation results have improvement.

Note that each time you updated ionosphere estimation results, you need to re-run the steps after
'#estimate ionospheric phase for each date' (including this step) in cmd_3.sh, as well as cmd_4.sh

4. ScanSAR burst synchronization
For ScanSAR data acquired before February 8, 2015, chances of having enough burst synchronization for 
interferometry are very low. Don't include data acquired before this date in your stack processing.
