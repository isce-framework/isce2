<!-- Shown above is the bare minimum input XML file for COSMO_SKYMED_SLC sensor. The reference and secondary catalog xml files have the same structure.

All file paths in the input files should either be absolute paths or relative to the processing directory.

    Note 1: Multiple Frames
    ========================

    Stitching multiple SLC frames is not possible with ISCE. Each frame is typically focussed with different parameters and they cannot be seamlessly stitched into a larger frame.
