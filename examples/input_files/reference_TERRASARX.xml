Shown above is the bare minimum input XML file for TERRASARX sensor.
The reference and secondary catalog xml files have the same structure.

All file paths in the input files should either be absolute paths or relative
to the processing directory.

    Note: Doppler Centroid
    =========================

    The doppler method must be set as follows in the insarApp.xml file

    <property name="doppler method">useDEFAULT</property>


The paths involved in specifying the location of the TerraSARX input xml file
consist of very long strings.  This is a case where use of the constant tag
(see the top level README.txt file) can help in constructing the paths.  At
the time of this release the constant tag does not work with catalog files.
This will be fixed in a future release.  In the meantime, you could go with
the above example reference.xml catalog file or else you can try the all-in-one
insarApp.xml style and use constants as in the following example:

========================================================================
Use the all-in-one style of insarApp.xml file.  In this examples the
paths to the reference and secondary input files are constructed from three
constants each.  It is assumed that you might have all of your downloaded
TerraSARX data in one place, which we reference with the constant named,
"tsx".  From there we use constants "d1" and "d2" to get to the directory
containing a directory that contains the xml file.  Then relative to those
directories we use b1 and b2 to name both the directory containing the
xml file and the xml file itself, since that is the convention used when
TerraSARX data are delivered.
