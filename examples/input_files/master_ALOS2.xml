<!-- Shown above is the bare minimum input XML file for ALOS2 sensor. The master and slave catalog xml files have the same structure.

All file paths in the input files should either be absolute paths or relative to the processing directory.

    Note 1: FBS/FBD 
    ================

     ISCE also allows for processing of similar ALOS2 acquisitions. We currently do not have access to pairs with FBD / FBS acquisitions to experiment with range oversampling. This functionality will be added as more data becomes available and if it turns out to be feasible to interfere such pairs.

    Note 2: Multiple frames
    ========================

    Stitching multiple SLC frames is not possible with ISCE. Each frame is typically focussed with different parameters and they cannot be seamlessly stitched into a larger frame.

    Note 3 : Doppler Centroid
    ==========================

   The doppler centroid data used for focusing the raw data is included in the metadata. The doppler method in "insarApp.xml" must be set to useDEFAULT for processing any SLC data.
